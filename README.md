# DeepTraffic_MIT


This is my solution for the competition enlisted on http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/deeptraffic/ .

I have also added an image which shows my score.(73.36) 

The leaderboard starts at 75.83 ----> http://selfdrivingcars.mit.edu/leaderboard/

I'm working on different types of activation function for the hidden layers. Thats the right direcion to go, to find a sweet spot for this problem.

I'll update, if done.
